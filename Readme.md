# Completing Pluralsight: "Kubernetes Installation and Configuration Fundamentals" with Vagrant

This course is somewhat agnostic on how the student implements the prescribed configurations, so I created this repository as an example implementation using Vagrant.

I assume you have already installed Vagrant on your system.

Provisioning for the VM's is found in the [Vagrantfile][vagrantfile]

Step through the [m03.sh][module_3] file to begin. 

[vagrantfile]:Vagrantfile
[module_3]:m03.sh
